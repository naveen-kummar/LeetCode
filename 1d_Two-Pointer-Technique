Explanation:
Initialization:

Start with x = 1 (minimum possible value of x) and y = 1000 (maximum possible value of y).
Two-Pointer Search:

Use the monotonicity properties of f(x, y):
If f(x, y) < z, increment x to increase the value of f(x, y).
If f(x, y) > z, decrement y to decrease the value of f(x, y).
If f(x, y) == z, store the pair (x, y) in the result and adjust
 both pointers (x++ and y--).

Efficiency:

The two-pointer approach ensures that each x and y are visited at 
most once, leading to an O(n) complexity where n is the range 
of x and y.

Output:

The result is a vector of integer pairs representing all 
valid (x, y) combinations where f(x, y) == z.

Usage Example:
Assume the custom function f(x, y) is implemented elsewhere:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    auto customFunction = [](int x, int y) { return x + y; }; // Example: f(x, y) = x + y
    int z = 5;

    vector<vector<int>> result = solution.findSolution(customFunction, z);

    // Print the result
    for (const auto& pair : result) {
        cout << "[" << pair[0] << ", " << pair[1] << "]" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
